This class is a port of my C++ ByteBuffer to provide Java's ByteBuffer functionality. Feel free to make any suggestions for improving the code or request any features that could be beneficial to a variety of applications that may use this class.

Why Byte Buffer?
-Relative and Absolute get() & put() methods
-Easier to work with than a raw byte array
-Read and Write large amounts of data
-Easy way to manipulate or create custom data structures

Example Program:
-dd_reader, a MBR / FAT Disk Image Parser: https://github.com/RamseyK/dd_reader
